INTRODUCTION:
i want to build a crud api in nodejs using express and typescript. 
the data is stored in a file called "items.csv". 
it contains data about counter strike: global offensive items on the steam market.
i have a scraper running that fetches data for all items and is supposed to update the corresponding rows in "items.csv".
to fetch the data it takes the id of an item and sends a request to the following url: https://steamcommunity.com/market/itemordershistogram?country=DE&language=german&currency=3&item_nameid=${id}&two_factor=0 where "${id}" is replaced by the id of the item. 
the returned json should then be send to my express and typescript crud api and through that updated in "items.csv"
each item in "items.csv" has the following fields:
1. id: unique identifier of an item used by the scraper to request the data
2. url: the market url of the item which is different to the url that the scraper uses. and is just used for reference.
3. highestBuyOrder: the highest currently listed buy order which is the highest price someone is willing to pay for the item at the moment.
4. lowestSellOrder: the lowest currently listed sell order which is the lowest price someone is willing to sell the item for at the moment.
5. sellsPerMonth: currently not implemented and should just be set to "0" for every item.
6. tracked: currently not implemented and should just be set to "false" for every item.
7. updatedAt: the last time the row of the item was updated which is represented by a timestamp.
in the upcoming conversation i want to you to help me implement the express + typescript crud api which the scraper is supposed to use to update the rows in "item.csv".
the only libraries you are allowed to use are "fs" and "express". don't use anything like "csvParse".
